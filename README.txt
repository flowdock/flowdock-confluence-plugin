You have successfully created a plugin using the Confluence plugin archetype!

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into Confluence and starts it on http://localhost:1990/confluence
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running Confluence instance
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
